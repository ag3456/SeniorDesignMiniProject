# SeniorDesignMiniProject

# Motivation
Senior Design groups in the past have have wasted time successfully connecting Raspbery pi's to the BU encrypted internet (802.1x), installing an operating system, and connecting external hardware to the pi. The purpose of this project was to eliminate this pitfall and have electrical engineers in their senior design groups well versed in this piece of hardware.

#Code 

#Part 1- Download OpenCv on Raspberry Pi. 

To download OpenCV on Raspberry Pi, we used the help provided in- https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html

#Part2 - Recording video using Raspberry Pi

To record the video using the Raspberry Pi, we first had to connect a camera to the pi. After this was connected we had to create a script using Python to record a video for 10 seconds. 



#Part 3 - Capturing Cars on the video recorded using code provided by Azfal Saan.
