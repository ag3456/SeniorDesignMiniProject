# SeniorDesignMiniProject

# Motivation
Senior Design groups in the past have have wasted time successfully connecting Raspbery pi's to the BU encrypted internet (802.1x), installing an operating system, and connecting external hardware to the pi. The purpose of this project was to eliminate this pitfall and have electrical engineers in their senior design groups well versed in this piece of hardware. 

# Materials

The purpose of this project is to count how many cars pass by in a frame using a Raspberry pi zero and a pi camera.  

# Code

This group used code from (Azfal Saan)[https://github.com/shaanhk]. Using  his code, we were unsuccessful detecting the cars that were passing by. We were somewhat able to detect objects.
